Overview
========
This document highlights the steps to compile Linux device
driver test cases for A32.


Steps to compile using bitbake
==============================
1. Create Bolt Linux build project using the steps
mentioned in http://10.10.10.22:8081/doku.php?id=build_linux_kernel_rootfs_bolt_asic_rev_a0.

2. Once the project is created either using bolt-firmware-5.4 scripts
or build release tarball, run the following command to set the environment.
   $ source setup.sh

3. Build a32-linux-dd-testcases recipe using bitbake.
   $ bitbake a32-linux-dd-testcases

4. The compiled test cases can be found at
tmp/work/cortexa32-neon-poky-linux-musleabi/a32-linux-dd-testcases/1.0-r6/image/ directory.

   Note: By default the a32-linux-dd-testcases package will be part of alif-tiny-image rootfs,
and the pre-compiled binaries can be found under /opt/linux_dd_test/ directory.


Steps to add testcases
======================
The additional test cases can be added by following the below steps.

1. Create a new test name directory under testcases directory.
   Example:
   $ cd testcases
   $ mkdir -p i2c

2. Create a C testcase source file.

3. Create include directory and add optional needed ".h" files into it.

4. Copy the testcases/mhu/Makefile into the newly created test name directory.
   Example:
   $ cp testcases/mhu/Makefile testcases/i2c/

5. The top level Makefile compiles ".c" files under newly created test name
   directory.
