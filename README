Overview
========
This document highlights the steps to compile Linux device
driver test cases for A32.


Steps to compile using bitbake
==============================
1. Create Bolt Linux build project using the steps
mentioned in http://10.10.10.22:8081/doku.php?id=build_linux_kernel_rootfs_bolt_asic_rev_a0.

2. Once the project is created either using bolt-firmware-5.4 scripts
or build release tarball, run the following command to set the environment.
   $ source setup.sh

3. Build test-app recipe using bitbake.
   $ bitbake test-app

4. The compiled test cases can be found at
tmp/work/cortexa32-neon-poky-linux-musleabi/test-app/1.0-r5/image/ directory.

   Note: By default the test-app package will be part of alif-tiny-image rootfs,
and the pre-compiled binaries can be found under /opt/linux_dd_test/ directory.
